# Louise Play Fever - Analysis 
      Week-1-Challenge

## Overview: 

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand the scope of success regarding the plays in crowdfunding campaigns. This analysis will provide evidence based on data analysis, which will be detailed within this project. With the help of Excel, I was able to get a deeper.

## Challenges: 
During this analysis, I encountered multiple challenging tasks. One of them was "Pivot tables", this was my first time making a complex table like this (see the image attached below). The challenging part about pivot tables is knowing how to interpret the data, you need to create an approach in which you would like Excel to output. As a learner, it is key to understand how they work. This is a very powerful tool, it was able to filter, and gather information across my data, analyzed it by creating values, and is also able to create interactive graphs according to the pivot table. With this tool, I was able to narrow down the information provided into a rationale based on evidence. 
A second challenge consisted of creating the tables according to my specifications (or shall we say Louise's needs). I was provided with an immense amount of data regarding crowdfunding campaigns, their location, the date started/ended, and their status to name a few. Louise was only focused on finding out specific rationales within her interests and their performance. So in order to satisfy their needs, I was able to narrow down the data needed to be inputted. Sounds easier than it is, or at least I thought so. understanding of the data provided which were used to build tables, graphs, and other visual tools that were key factors in the analysis.

## Analysis Overview:
By understanding Louise's needs and interests, I was able to analyze his favorite plays and their outcomes based on success (in this case their goal). It was fascinating how the analysis came out to be. We were able to organize the data into parent categories, and subcategories, color-coded by outcomes, and values. The pivot tables were part of that tool, as well as filters in the Kickstarter sheet (main data sheet). We based our statistical components on the main sheet, this was a step further to deepen our analysis for Louise. These statistics provide unbias analysis in order to make further conclusions. 


## Results: 

### Theather Outcomes by Launch Date
Our first task was to interpret the Kickstarter campaigns and resize them to our needs, like I previously mentioned, Louise was primarily focused on plays. So I gathered the following data from our "Kickstarter" sheet in order to interpret the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". 

      See image 4 attached below: 
      https://github.com/Sergg99/Week-1-Challenge/blob/7efd444bb7415ca75c9006be481c83ee280f6820/Challange%20Week%201/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

On the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" graph we can observe the outcomes based on the months. We can see a peak regarding successful plays in Spring, highlighted in blue. On the other hand, we have a steady number of canceled plays across the entire year, except for the month of October, while November-December returns back to "normal". Based on this data, we can assume people are more likely to visit the theater and enjoy a play. 
We can also assume that plays launched in Spring are more likely to succeed than plays launched in the Winter, as we can see there is a substantial decrease in success rate in the months of November to December. Indicating that it is the worst time of the year to introduce/launch a play according to our data. 

### Outcomes Based on Goal 

Our second task was to develop and interpret the data revolving around the success rate of plays regarding their (financial) goal. The outcomes were divided into percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled. 

      See image 5 attached below: 
      https://github.com/Sergg99/Week-1-Challenge/blob/7efd444bb7415ca75c9006be481c83ee280f6820/Challange%20Week%201/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png

Based on our data we can conclude that plays that have lower expectations/goals, usually perform better than most plays that have higher goals. As we can see in the image. While a substantial amount of plays that end in failure have a higher expectation regarding their goal amount, labeled in orange. On average there is more "expensive" failure than there are successes with regard to outcomes based on their goal. 


### Summary

Louise's analysis consists of the outcomes of plays based on their goals, we created a table based on a count of successful plays of her interest, as well as the number of failed and canceled campaigns. A percentage was obtained from each category from the total projections of the plays. We concluded that there were more successful plays in the first quartile (based on goal). 
On the other hand, we looked at the count of outcomes based on their success, failure, or canceled campaigns and the date of their launch. We concluded that there were more successful outcomes in the month of May. The visual representations of the data interpretation were able to give Louise the understanding she needed to one day launch her own successful campaign. 
      Some limitations to the pivot tables I face is that you need to know what you are trying to achieve in order to use them to your advantage. Any graph also applies, depending on your data, you may need to see what suits your needs. In this case we were able to understand Louise's needs, which made this proccess a lot easer.
