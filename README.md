# Louise Play Fever - Analysis 
      Week-1-Challenge

## Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand the scope of success regarding the plays in crowdfunding campaings. This analysis will provide evicence based on data analysis, in which will be detailed within this project. With the help of Excel, I was able to get a deeper understanding of the data provided which were used to build tables, graphs, and other visual tools that were key factors in the analysis.

## Challenges: 
During this analysis, I encounterd multiple challenging tasks. One of them was "Pivot tables", this was my first time making a complex table like this (see image attached belowe). The challenging part about pivot tables is knowing how to interpret the data, you need to create an approach in which you would like Excel to output. As a learner, it is key to understand how they work. This is a very powerful tool, it was able to filter, gather information across my data, analyzed it by creating values, and is also able to create interactive graphs according to the pivot table. With this tool, I was able to narrow down the information provided into a rational based on evidence. 
A second challenge consisted on creating the tables according to my specifications (or shall we say Louise's needs). I was provided with an inmense amout of data regarding crowdfunding campaings, their location, date started/ended, and their status to name a few. Louise was only focused in finding out specific rationales within her interests and their performance. So in order to satisfy their needs, I was able to narrow down the data needed to be inputted. Sounds easier than it is, or at lest I thought so.

## Analysis Overview:
By understanding Louise's needs and interests, I was able to analize his favorite plays and their outcomes based on success (in this case their goal). It was facinating how the analysis came out to be. We were able to organize the data into parent categories, subcategories, color coded by outcomes, and values. The pivot tables were part of that tool, as well as filters in the kickstarter sheet (main data sheet). We based out statistical components from out main sheet, this was a step further to deepen our analysis for Louise. These statistics provide unbias analysis in order to make further conclusions. 


## Results: 

### Theather Outcomes by Launch Date
Our first task was to interpret the kickstarter campaigns and resize it to our needs, like I previously mentioned, Louise was primarily focused on plays. So I gathered the following data from our "Kickstarter" sheet in order to interet the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". 

      See image 4 attached below: 
      https://github.com/Sergg99/Week-1-Challenge/blob/7efd444bb7415ca75c9006be481c83ee280f6820/Challange%20Week%201/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

On the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" graph we can observe the outcomes based on the months. We can see see a peak regarding successful plays in Spring, highlited in blue. On the other hand, we have a steady number of canceled plays across the entire year, except for the month of October, while in November-December returns back to "normal". Based on this data, we can assume people are more likely to visit the theater and enjoy a play. 
We can also assume that plays launched on Spring are more likely to succeeed than plays launched on the Winter, as we can see there is a substantial decrese in success rate in the months of November to December. Indicating that it is the worst time of the year to introduce/launch a play according to our data. 

### Outcomes Based on Goal 

Our second task was to develop and interpret the data revolving the success rate of plays regarding their (financial) goal. The outcomes were devided into percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled. 

      See image 5 attached below:

Based on our data we can conclude that plays that have lower expectations/goals, usually perform better than in most plays that have higher goals. As we can see in image. While a subtantial amount of plays that end in a failure have higher expectation regarding their goal amount, labeled in orange. On average there are more "expensive" failure than there are successes with regard to outcomes based on their goal.
